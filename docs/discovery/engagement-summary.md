  Core Goals (Baseline — Phase 1 "Must-Haves")

  1. Term Sheet Skill

  A working, highly reliable Claude skill that extracts 9 key 
  term-sheet points and flags deviations from standard
  positions:

  | #   | Term                                | What to Extract

                                                 |
  |-----|-------------------------------------|----------------
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  -----------------------------------------------|
  | 1   | Pre-Money & Post-Money Valuation    | Exact company
  valuation the investment is based on
                                                  |
  | 2   | Total Investment Amount             | Amount raised,
  split by investor (if specified), milestone-based tranches
                                                 |
  | 3   | Liquidation Preference              | Multiplier (1x,
   2x), participating vs non-participating (participating =
  major red flag, must be flagged)                  |
  | 4   | Founder Vesting Schedule            | Duration &
  cliff (standard: 4 years, 1-year cliff — flag deviations),
  acceleration terms (single-trigger / double-trigger) |
  | 5   | Board Composition & Observer Rights | Who appoints
  directors (Common, Series A, etc.), non-voting observer seats
                                                   |
  | 6   | Protective Provisions (Veto Rights) | What decisions
  require investor consent (issuing shares, selling company,
  changing budget)                                 |
  | 7   | Exclusivity ("No-Shop") Period      | Is there a
  binding exclusivity clause, duration (typically 30-45 days)
                                                     |
  | 8   | Governing Law & Jurisdiction        | English law vs
  US/Delaware law (critical for H&V)
                                                 |
  | 9   | Legal Fees & Expenses               | Who pays, is
  there a cap on investor legal fees the startup covers
                                                   |

  Success criteria: Consistently extract these 9 items from any
   draft PDF, map to structured summary, flag deviations from
  standard.

  2. Due Diligence Skill

  A working Claude skill that reads a folder of target company
  documents and maps them against Priya's fixed 25-point 
  checklist, pointing to exact document and page for
  verification.

  Success criteria: Accurate mapping, no invented checklist
  items, explicit PRESENT/MISSING/N/A for every item.

  Stretch Goals (Phase 2)

  1. "Approved Skills" Pipeline

  A private, versioned repository for vetted skills that all 10
   lawyers can install from:
  - Centralized, secure way to manage and push approved skills
  - When v2 of a skill ships, all lawyers get the update
  - Documented approval + versioning process (who vets, how
  updates roll out)
  - Eliminates current chaos of 10 lawyers running different
  local prompts

  2. Partner-Ready Data Security Briefing

  A formal, written, non-technical document for Priya and
  partners explaining:
  - Where client data goes when lawyers use Claude
  - How data-residency works
  - Why it complies with UK GDPR and SRA guidelines
  - Zero training on client data, no indefinite storage
  - This is the gate to project sign-off — without it, even
  perfect tech gets vetoed

  ---
  Non-Negotiables (from JSON)

  1. Absolute client data privacy — watertight answer on data
  residency and zero training on their data
  2. Strictly internal use only — human-in-the-loop, no
  client-facing interaction whatsoever

  ---
  Tom's Three Main Priorities

  1. Client Data Security (Non-Negotiable) — Must prove to
  Priya data doesn't leave secure boundary or train public
  models
  2. Working Internal Skills — The two specific workflows
  (term-sheet extraction + DD mapping) proven on real files
  3. Governance & Scalability — Centralized way to manage/push
  approved skills to all 10 lawyers

  ---
  Important Considerations (The "Final 10%")

  1. Partner-Ready Formatting — Output must be in Harrow & Vale
   memorandum format, not raw markdown. Professional, polished
  documents.
  2. Human Vetting and Strategic Advice — Claude extracts and
  flags; qualified lawyer still reviews, provides strategic
  counsel, negotiates. AI does 90% grunt work, lawyers do 10%
  high-value expertise.
  3. Security Assurance — Proving to Priya that client data
  never leaves secure boundary or trains public models.

  User Personas

  1. Priya Vale (Managing Partner)

  - 20+ years M&A/VC experience, highly risk-averse
  - Will shut down initiative instantly if she smells
  compliance risk or data leak
  - Cares about: billable quality, absolute confidentiality,
  her 25-point DD checklist followed to the letter
  - Her sign-off is required — solution must be airtight

  2. The Associates (Power Users)

  - Junior/mid-level, drowning in paperwork
  - Started using Claude to speed up reading 100-page leases
  and cross-checking cap tables
  - Want things to work now — if clunky (10 buttons, 5 portals,
   5-minute waits), they abandon it
  - Care about: speed, simplicity, seamless SharePoint
  integration

  3. The "Tech-Savvy" Associate

  - Younger corporate associate, hobbyist coder
  - Has tried writing prompts to parse documents
  - Currently a loose cannon running own experiments
  - Need to channel his energy into the governed pipeline

  4. Tom Harrow (Ops & Knowledge Lead)

  - Bridge between Priya's risk-aversion and associates' demand
   for speed
  - Job: keep lights on, keep compliant, give lawyers tools to
  compete
  - Warning: "If your prototype is clunky, associates won't use
   it. If it's insecure, Priya will fire us both."

  The Environment

  - High-pressure, fast-paced boutique
  - Every hour spent on bad software = hour not billing or
  winning new business
  - Need: simple, secure, highly targeted tools

  Deliverables (Due Wed 29 July 2026)

  1. Client proposal — approach, scope, honest time/effort
  estimates, priced to £2k-£5k budget
  2. Solution presentation — demo the working solution running
  3. Next steps — how client takes it further / next engagement
  4. Public case study — how Claude solved it (Anthropic-style,
   public-facing)
